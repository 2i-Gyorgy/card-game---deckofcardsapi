Hi! This repo is for me to learn about API's and OOP both in python and Java.

Folders java_cards and python_cards both contain the rules of the game 21.
My code knows the rules and you can play 21 with it, but it has no idea about handeling decks or cards.
These come from https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/. deckofcardsapi is a web service that can create and shuffle decks, and deal cards form this deck.
All interaction between my code and deckofcardsapi is through API calls.

Once the basic functionality is there I'm planing to expand on these and make them fancy by creating a GUI.
